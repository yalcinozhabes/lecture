0.  How much time did you spend on this pre-class exercise, and when?

1.  What are one or two points that you found least clear in the
    9/22 slide decks (including the narration)?

2.  The pthread_mc.c file in the demo subdirectory runs a Monte Carlo
    simulation to estimate the expected value of a uniform random
    variable.  The "-p" option sets the number of processors used,
    while "-b" sets the number of trials between synchronizations.

    a) Write a model for the run time for this simulation code in
       terms of the number of trials (N), number of processors (p),
       time per trial (t_trial), and time to update the global
       counters in the critical section (t_update).

        totalRunTime = (N/p)*t_trial + (N/batchSize) * t_update

    b) Run the code with a few different parameter values in order
       to estimate N, t_trial, and t_update for this code on
       a totient compute node.

       I wasn't able to run the code on the compute node, but it worked
       on the head node.

    c) Based on your model, suggest a strategy for choosing the batch
       size.  How might you generalize this strategy to automatically
       choose batch sizes for different types of computational
       experiments?
    
3.  In the workq subdirectory of this directory, there is a basic work
    queue implementation.  Following the strategy outlined in the
    slides, add synchronization calls in the locations marked TODO.
    You should run the code to make sure it behaves as expected!
